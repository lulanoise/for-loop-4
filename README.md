# Exercise: For Loop 4
* define a class `CustomNumber` that has:
  * an instance variable called `number`
  * a constructor that generates and prints a random number between 1 and 12 and assigns it to `number`
  * a method called `getMultiplicationTable` that prints all the multiplication table for `number` in descending order (from 12 to 1)
* define a testing class where you create a `CustomNumber` and call the method
